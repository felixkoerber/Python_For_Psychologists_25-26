# Introduction V

Within the fifth session we'll continue to explore the basic building blocks of `python`, this and the next `session` will contain exhaustive content aiming to provide you with a somewhat detailed understanding of central `python` aspects. The aim is to get a good set of basic experience to then advance into more practical aspects, specifically evaluating how these things can be utilized within `experiments` to collect data and their subsequent `analyzes`. To nevertheless get some experience on the way, there will be some exercise at the beginning and throughout the session. Additionally, the `homework assignments` will be made in a way that showcases some tasks that you might most likely encounter in real-life so that you get more practice in conducting them through `python`.

## Introduction to Python - II
This session, we'll build upon the things learn last week and broader our capabilities in `python`, focusing on `operations`, `comparisons` and `data types`/`structures`. 

## Objectives üìç

- learn basic and efficient usage of the `python` programming language
  - what is `python` & how to utilize it
  - `operations` & `comparison` in `python`
  - `data types` & `structures`
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

## Materials üìì

Please see the rendered version of the `jupyter notebook` [Introduction V - Introduction to Python II](https://aylinsgl.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_23-24/introduction/intro_python_II.html) in the `ToC` on the left.


Your fourth homework assignment will entail working through a few tasks covering the contents discussed in this session within of a `jupyter notebook`. You can download it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oHi1P3YzNLIKvhUx9TlmtmbIZT5Q2zHx/view?usp=sharing). In order to open it, put the `homework assignment notebook` within the folder you stored the `course materials`, start a `jupyter notebook` as during the sessions, navigate to the `homework assignment notebook`, open it and have fun! NB: a substantial part of it will be _optional_ and thus the notebook will look way longer than it actually is. Also remember that you can work on your homework in groups, as long as you indicate at the top of the homework notebook, with whom you've worked together.

**Deadline: 24/11/2023, 11:59 PM EST**

You can download the second part of the homework [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y6QfwfszbtSP7_hKFXtEEROK40KBwJ77/view?usp=sharing). 

**It is due next Friday, December 1st, 11:59 PM**
