# Introduction

In the first block of this course we will focus on the basics of programming, obviously with a focus on `python`. However, before we will actually
start exploring this fantastic programming language we will go on side-quest that might seem unrelated and adjacent at best but is indeed very important
for programming and computational work in general. After that we will spend three session on exploring `python`'s building blocks from `variables` over `common operations` to `functions`.
