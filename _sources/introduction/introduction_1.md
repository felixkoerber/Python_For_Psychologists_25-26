# Introduction I

Within the first session we'll spend a fair amount of time on talking about the structure, content, goal and implementation of the course to hopefully answer most of your questions and set the stage for the subsequent meetings! This will also entail an introduction section to get to know the folks around you. As first homework assignment, you will be asked to try to install the necessary software for the course until next week.

## Tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

- Your main task for this week is to install the following software packages on your laptop computer: python3 (miniconda), the VScode editor, and the VScode extensions, as described in the [setup section of the course website](https://cfiebach.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_25-26/setup.html). PLEASE WAIT UNTIL YOU GET MY 'GO-SIGNAL' FOR THE INSTALLATION ... we want to be sure everything works. There will also be the opportunity to consult a student from my lab when you have problems with the installation. Details will follw.
- If you happen to have a running version of python3 and a code editor, you are good to go, even if you have different installation / software.
- Check whether you have a bash shell on your computer, also as described on the setup page.
- Everything else - like downloading materials for the course - we will do together in the next session.
- Your third task is to download the ebook 'Python for Experimental Psychologists' from the University Library website. Have a look at Chapter 1 - but don't follow their installation instructions - use the ones from our website!
