    "# New Year recap\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's session, we will do a recap of the concepts that most of you indicated needed some more practicing. This includes looking back at for and while loops as well as functions. Even if you feel pretty confident already, continued practice on new problems is always a good way to solidify your knowledge. If you feel like you're lagging behind and you don't understand these concepts at all, please go back to the previous [Python III notebook](\"https://aylinsgl.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_23-24/introduction/intro_python_III.html\") and keep revising these topics. Today, we will do some live problem solving and work on more example exercises."
