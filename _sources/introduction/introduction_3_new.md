# Introduction III

The things covered in this section will introduce central concepts for our subsequent endeavors in this class. More precisely, we'll explore `jupyter notebooks` as one form of interacting with your computer, specifically `python`. Getting a good hang of this will be important as most of our `python` endeavors will happen within `jupyter notebooks` and they are a staple in research workflows.

## Create environment
Download the following [environment file](https://github.com/aylinsgl/Python_For_Psychologists_23-24/blob/master/environment.yaml)
In your terminal, type `conda env create -f path/to/your/file/pfp_2023.yml` replacing 'path/to/your/file/' with the actual filepath.


## Jupyter notebooks
We will now take a closer look at `jupyter notebook` and how we can work with them. This is a central topic as the `python introduction` and `data analyzes` parts of the course will be conducted via `jupyter notebook` and you'll have to hand in most assignments via them as well.  

## Objectives üìç

- learn basic and efficient usage of the jupyter ecosystem & notebooks
    - what is Jupyter & how to utilize jupyter notebooks
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

## Materials üìì

Please see the rendered version of the `jupyter notebook` [Introduction III - jupyter notebooks](https://aylinsgl.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_23-24/introduction/intro_jupyter.html) in the `ToC` on the left.

## Homework

You should create a `jupyter notebook` with
- **mandatory**:  `3 different cells`:
            - 1 rendered markdown cell within which you name your favorite movie and describe why you like it via  
              max. 2 sentences
            - 1 code cell with an equation (e.g. `1+1`, `(a+b)/(c+d)`, etc.)
            - 1 raw cell with your favorite snack
- **optional**: try to include a picture of your favorite animal
- save the notebook and e-mail it to kallmayer@psych.uni-frankfurt.de

Please note that the deadline for the assignment is: 10/11/2021, 11:59 PM EST.
