Hello everyone and welcome to the course page for "Python for Psychologists", taught
within the [Psychology master programme](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/51789866/Institute_of_Psychology?) of the [Goethe-University Frankfurt](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/en) during the winter term 2025-2026. Glad to see you here!

Within these pages, we provide the all information important to follow and conduct the course, including formal aspects, requirements, lecture materials, practicals and so on.  This [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) will include the used slides and code in a way that they can be explored in an interactive manner. You can navigate through the respective sections via the TOC (table of contents) on the left side and within sections via the TOC on the right side. The three symbols in the top allow enabling full screen mode, link to the underlying [Github repository](https://github.com/cfiebach/Python_For_Psychologists_25-26) and allow you to download the contents as a pdf or [jupyter notebook]() respectively. Some sections will additionally have a little rocket in that row which will allow you to interactively rerun certain parts of the practicals via cloud computing. All of this awesomeness (talking about the infrastructure and resource) is possible through the dedicated and second to none work of the [Jupyter community](https://jupyter.org/), specifically, the [Executable/Jupyter Book](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/) and [mybinder project](https://mybinder.org/).

## Python for Psychologists

Within this course we will explore the [Python programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), specifically how it can and why it should be utilized within experimental
psychology. To do so, we will follow a "learning by doing" approach in a tripartite manner. Starting from a basic introduction into `programming` and `python` (Block I), we will evaluate how `python` can be used to run `experiments` (Block II) and `analyze` the resulting `data` (Block III). Thus, we actively seek out `realistic examples` and `workflows`, trying to solve problems with `python`.  Along this way we will also talk about important adjacent topics such as `computing environments` and `IDE`s. For a more precise outline of the course, please consult the [respective section](https://github.com/cfiebach/Python_For_Psychologists_25-26/setup.html).
This course is designed to provide lecture content in a way that it is [FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) for as many people as possible.

You can use the following sections to navigate through the content of the lecture:

* [Overview & procedure ](https://cfiebach.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_25-26/overview.html)

   What's this course all about? How are things implemented and supposed to work?

* [General outline](https://cfiebach.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_25-26/outline.html)

   What are the specific topics and aspects taught?

* [Introduction](https://cfiebach.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_25-26/introduction/introduction.html)

   All things gotta start somewhere and using programming within research settings is no exception to
   that, but how?

* [Running experiments in Python](https://cfiebach.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_25-26/experiments/experiments.html#)

   How can you use python to conduct experiments to acquire data from participants?

* [Data analyses in Python](https://cfiebach.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_25-26/analyses/analyses.html)

   How can you use python to obtain insights from data, including preprocessing, statistics and visualizations?

* [Student projects](https://cfiebach.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_25-26/projects.html)

   Making sure the work and progress of the participants is transparent and
   documented.

* [Questionnaires](https://cfiebach.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_25-26/questionnaires.html)

   Was it worth it and how can this be evaluated?

* [Code of Conduct](https://cfiebach.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_25-26/CoC.html)

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive learning
   experience.

## I've got a question!

In case you have any questions or difficulties with the lecture and its materials, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch with us. A great way to do this is to open an issue on the GitHub site of the course. You can of course further contact me via [E-mail](fiebach@psych.uni-frankfurt.de). Every feedback or idea  you might have is highly appreciated and valued. Please remember that I am teaching several courses in parallel and while I will do my best to get back to everyone in a timely manner, please be understanding if I don't and feel free to send me another reminder email or approach me after class.
